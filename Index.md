Welcome to Galleria.
Galleria is a math research tool I created to study analytical geometry in a coop undergraduate research project with my Professor Richard Low from SJSU. You construct a polygon of any shape which is your art gallery. Then you can place guards (with 360-degree sight) that can see through any amount of walls (default 0 walls). When computed, it will generate the line of sight of the guards.

PATCHES
Version 1.9

Implemented being able to create polygons inside polygons.
Made Wall lines thicker
STILL IN CONSTRUCTION: Light Gallery Feature
Version 1.2 to Version 1.8

Buttons are implemented,
Guard to any Nth power of vision is implemented.
No more gross GUI on the drawing window.
Removed certain hotkeys, kept most important ones.
Version 1.7

Snapshot exports to the desktop instead.
Version 1.6

Added Black outline on the guards
Created JPEG export to folder in C:\ ArtGalleryExports
Version 1.5

Made the Saturation of lines more.
Guard can now be created to see any amount of walls(not only 1).
Created Java document (in the SRC).
Version 1.4

Fixed a problem where too many guards placed at a fast rate would catch.
Made it possible to place guards outside of the Gallery
Version 1.3

Computation Works
Guards Change Color
Window Resizable
Vertices are smaller
Version 1.2

Redid the code so now that things are in its own classes, such as Guards, Walls(instead of lines).

created guards that can create lines 360 degrees, but computation of those lines still to be figured out.
